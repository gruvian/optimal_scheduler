Optimal Scheduler is a simple productivity project developed for creating an optimal weekly schedule that maximizes productivity while prioritizing mental wellbeing.<br /> <br />
While manual entry is possible, the program is designed to automatically create a timetable that prioritizes adequate sleep, working hours, personalized study hours per day for each subject 
and time allocated for mental wellbeing. <br /> <br />
It's written in Python, uses PyQt5 for GUI and stores and reads timetable data in JSON. <br /> <br />
Course/task difficulty is first modeled by traditional ECTS formula, user inputted rating and previous grades earned on similar subjects to give a personalized prediction and uses a Greedy algorithm to produce a maximally productive timetable. <br /> 
<br /> This project was created for personal use which is reflected in design choices and functionality.
